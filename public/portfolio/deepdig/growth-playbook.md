# ClawWork.io Growth Playbook — February 2026
**Created:** 2026-02-02  
**Purpose:** Top 10 prioritized growth strategies with specific actions, timelines, and ownership (AI-autonomous vs Josh-required)

---

## Executive Summary

ClawWork.io is entering a market with **proven demand** (18,347% surge on Fiverr, 147K agents on Moltbook in a week) but **no open marketplace leader**. The protocol infrastructure (A2A, AP2, x402, ERC-8004) is being built, but the marketplace layer is missing. This is a **first-mover window** — estimated 6-12 months before enterprise players (Salesforce, Google) or incumbents (Fiverr/Upwork) fill the gap.

**The core thesis:** Whoever builds critical mass of agents + tasks first wins via network effects. Our playbook focuses on speed-to-community, not perfection.

---

### 🥈 STRATEGY 2: Product Hunt Launch (Week 4-5, target Tuesday Feb 18 or Wed Feb 19)
**Impact: VERY HIGH | Effort: HIGH | Owner: JOINT (Josh leads, AI supports)**

Product Hunt remains the single highest-impact launch event for developer/AI tools. In 2026, the key changes:
- You can re-launch with significant updates
- Pre-launch follower collection is critical
- Hunter selection matters more than ever
- 6-week prep is ideal (we have ~2-3 weeks — compress the timeline)

**Pre-Launch Actions (Start NOW, Feb 2-14):**
1. Create "Coming Soon" page on Product Hunt → collect followers
2. Find and secure a Hunter (well-known PH community member) — reach out to top hunters via DM
3. Prepare assets:
   - Tagline: "The marketplace where AI agents get hired" (or similar — test 3 options)
   - 4-6 high-quality product screenshots/GIFs
   - 60-90 second demo video showing an agent being hired and completing a task
   - Maker's comment: personal origin story (Josh's voice)
   - FAQ answers pre-written
4. Build anticipation: daily X posts for 7 days before launch with teasers
5. Notify network: email list, Discord communities, X followers
6. Pre-write outreach messages to supporters

**Launch Day Execution (Feb 18/19):**
- Launch at 12:01 AM PST (maximize 24-hour window)
- Maker's comment posted immediately
- Share across ALL channels within first hour
- Respond to every PH comment within minutes (Josh + AI tag-team)
- Post updates throughout the day (metrics, screenshots, user stories)
- Target: Top 5 product of the day (needs ~300-900 upvotes)

**🤖 AI can do:** Draft all copy (tagline, description, FAQ, maker's comment), create launch day social posts, monitor and draft responses to PH comments, coordinate cross-posting schedule
**👤 Josh needs to:** Record demo video, approve all copy, personally engage in PH comments (authenticity matters), reach out to Hunter, rally personal network

**Timeline:** Prep Feb 2-17, Launch Feb 18 or 19

---

### 🥉 STRATEGY 3: X/Twitter Build-in-Public Engine (Ongoing, start Day 1)
**Impact: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Owner: JOINT (AI drafts, Josh approves/posts)**

X is where the AI agent conversation lives. The strategy: become the go-to voice for "AI agent marketplace" discourse.

---

### 4️⃣ STRATEGY 4: Hacker News "Show HN" Launch (Week 3, ~Feb 11-13)
**Impact: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Owner: JOINT**

HN is the developer credibility platform. Do this BEFORE Product Hunt to build technical credibility that carries over.

**Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM EST. Target Feb 11 (Tue) or Feb 12 (Wed).

**Title Format:**
- "Show HN: ClawWork – An open marketplace to hire and deploy AI agents"
- Include "open" (HN loves open platforms) — avoid "AI-powered" (oversaturated)

**Top-Level Comment Must Include:**
1. What it does (2 sentences max)
2. Why you built it (the gap: protocols exist, marketplace doesn't)
3. Tech stack and architecture decisions
4. What's working and what's not yet (honesty = respect)
5. What's next on the roadmap
6. Ask: "What would make you trust an AI agent marketplace?"

**Critical:** Josh must be available to respond to comments for 4-6 hours straight. HN rewards deep, honest engagement. Marketing-speak gets destroyed.

**🤖 AI can do:** Draft the Show HN post and top-level comment, research current HN sentiment on AI agents, prepare answers to likely technical questions
**👤 Josh needs to:** Post it (personal account has more credibility), be the one responding to all comments live, handle technical questions authentically

---

### 5️⃣ STRATEGY 5: Community Infiltration — Discord, Telegram, Reddit (Weeks 1-4, ongoing)
**Impact: HIGH | Effort: HIGH | Owner: JOINT**

---

### 6️⃣ STRATEGY 6: Strategic Partnership & Integration Pipeline (Weeks 2-6)
**Impact: VERY HIGH | Effort: HIGH | Owner: Josh (relationships)**

Partnerships create supply-side and demand-side network effects simultaneously. Focus on three types:

**Type A: Framework Integrations (supply-side — bring agents to ClawWork)**
| Partner | Integration | Value |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| CrewAI | One-click deploy CrewAI agents to ClawWork marketplace | Huge developer base, agents ready to list |
| LangGraph/LangChain | LangGraph agents listable on ClawWork | Largest agent framework ecosystem |
| AutoGen (Microsoft) | Deploy AutoGen agents to marketplace | Enterprise developer base |

**Type B: Protocol Integrations (infrastructure credibility)**
| Partner | Integration | Value |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| A2A Protocol (Google) | Support Agent Cards for discovery | Industry standard compliance |
| MCP (Anthropic) | MCP-compatible agent tools | De facto tool integration standard |
| x402 (Coinbase) | Micropayments for agent tasks | Crypto-native payments |
| ERC-8004 | On-chain reputation for agents | Trust/verification layer |

**Type C: Demand-side Partnerships (bring tasks/clients)**
| Partner | Approach | Value |
|---------|----------|-------|
| n8n | "Hire an agent" node in n8n workflows | Workflow users = task posters |
| Zapier/Make | Agent marketplace integration | Automation users need agents |
| Notion/Slack | AI agent marketplace bot | Enterprise discovery |
| Moltbook | Cross-promote to 147K+ agents | Massive supply-side injection |

**👤 Josh needs to:** Make initial contact (founder-to-founder), attend calls, negotiate terms, sign agreements

---

### 7️⃣ STRATEGY 7: Content Marketing Engine — Dev.to, Blog, YouTube (Weeks 2-8)
**Impact: HIGH (compound) | Effort: MEDIUM | Owner: AI (drafts), Josh (review)**

Content that's getting traction in AI/crypto right now (Feb 2026):

**Format Rankings by Engagement:**
1. **Short-form video demos** (30-60 sec) — "Watch this AI agent do X" — highest viral potential
2. **Technical threads on X** (3-6 tweets) — 3x engagement vs single tweets
3. **Long-form technical blog posts** — best for SEO, developer credibility
4. **Podcast appearances** — growing importance as AI search favors human conversations
5. **Data-driven posts** — proprietary data from your marketplace = unique content moat
6. **Behind-the-scenes build content** — specifics > vague claims, always

**Content Calendar — First Month:**

| Week | Dev.to Article | X Thread | Video |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | "Why the AI Agent Marketplace Layer is Missing" | Thread: protocol stack visualization | - |
| 2 | "Building Agent Reputation: ERC-8004 + Practical Implementation" | Thread: "I analyzed 50 AI agents, here's what the best have in common" | 30-sec demo: hiring an agent |
| 3 | "How A2A Agent Cards Power Agent Discovery" | Thread: "The AI agent economy is about to explode, here's why" | 60-sec walkthrough |
| 4 | "Lessons from Week 1: Our AI Agent Marketplace Numbers" | Thread: Launch metrics + learnings | User testimonial clip |

**Key 2026 Content Trends to Leverage:**
- **Reddit/community presence matters for AI search visibility** — AI-powered search engines surface Reddit discussions prominently
- **Proprietary data = unfair advantage** — share unique marketplace data others can't get
- **Human voice > AI-generated** — audiences crave authentic, experience-based content
- **Podcasts and audio** — growing channel; pitch to appear on AI-focused podcasts (Bankless AI Rollup, Latent Space, The AI Breakdown)

**🤖 AI can do:** Draft all articles, threads, and scripts; optimize for SEO; schedule publishing; repurpose content across formats
**👤 Josh needs to:** Review/approve articles, record videos, appear on podcasts, share personal stories

---

### 8️⃣ STRATEGY 8: Crypto AI Agent Community Activation (Weeks 1-4)
**Impact: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Owner: JOINT**

The crypto × AI agent intersection is the most active community right now. This audience is:
- Comfortable with new marketplace models
- Already thinking about agent economies
- Willing to be early adopters
- Active on X, Discord, Telegram

**Specific Actions:**

1. **Virtuals Protocol ecosystem** — List ClawWork as the "hiring layer" for Virtuals agents. Virtuals creates agents; ClawWork lets them get hired for tasks.

2. **ai16z/ElizaOS ecosystem** — Position ClawWork as the marketplace where Eliza-framework agents find work. Integrate with ElizaOS directly if possible.

3. **CookieDAO / Kaito** — Get ClawWork tracked on Kaito's AI mindshare metrics. CookieDAO's data layer could feed into agent reputation.

4. **ERC-8004 community** — Actively participate in the standard's development. Being an early implementer = credibility + co-marketing.

5. **AIXBT engagement** — The most-followed crypto AI agent. Getting acknowledged/discussed by AIXBT = massive visibility in the crypto AI audience.

6. **Moltbook presence** — Post in /m/agents about building the marketplace layer. The 147K agents there are potential supply-side users.

**🤖 AI can do:** Monitor crypto AI discussions, draft community posts, engage on Moltbook, track Kaito mindshare metrics
**👤 Josh needs to:** Attend crypto AI Twitter Spaces, build relationships with protocol teams, handle any token/financial discussions

---

### 9️⃣ STRATEGY 9: Early User Incentive Program (Week 3-6)
**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Owner: JOINT**

Bootstrap the marketplace chicken-and-egg problem: you need agents AND tasks simultaneously.

**Supply-Side (Agent Builders):**
- "First 100 agents listed get lifetime featured placement"
- "Zero listing fees for first 6 months" (then small fee)
- "Agent Builder of the Week" spotlight on X + newsletter
- Exclusive Discord channel for early agent builders (makes them feel special)
- Hackathon: "Build an agent, list it on ClawWork, win [prize]"

**Demand-Side (Task Posters):**
- "$50 in free agent credits" for first 500 users
- "First task free" promotion
- Case study partnership: "We'll document your agent hiring journey"
- Referral program: invite 3 friends, get $25 credit each

**Community Mechanics:**
- Early access waitlist (creates scarcity)
- "Founding Member" badge for first 1,000 users
- Weekly AMA with the team
- Public roadmap where community votes on features

**🤖 AI can do:** Set up referral tracking, draft promotional copy, manage waitlist communications, write case studies
**👤 Josh needs to:** Decide on incentive budgets, approve financial commitments, host AMAs, make partnership calls

---

### 🔟 STRATEGY 10: PR & Podcast Outreach Blitz (Weeks 3-6)
**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Owner: JOINT**

The "marketplace layer is missing" narrative is genuinely newsworthy. Pitch it.

**Podcasts to Pitch (AI + Crypto):**
| Podcast | Host | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| Latent Space | swyx + Alessio | Top AI engineering podcast, perfect audience |
| The AI Breakdown | NLW | Daily AI news, covers agent trends |
| Bankless AI Rollup | @cryptopunk7213 | Crypto × AI focus, already in our engagement list |
| Lex Fridman (stretch) | Lex Fridman | If the "Upwork for AI agents" framing lands |
| Indie Hackers Podcast | Courtland Allen | Build-in-public angle |
| My First Million | Sam Parr + Shaan Puri | Business opportunity framing |
| All-In (stretch) | Chamath et al | AI economy angle |

**Media/Blog Outlets to Pitch:**
| Outlet | Angle |
|--------|-------|
| TechCrunch | "The AI Agent Marketplace Gap: $50B market with no marketplace" |
| The Verge | "Meet the 'Upwork for AI agents'" |
| CoinDesk | "Crypto protocols are building agent infrastructure, but who builds the marketplace?" |
| Forbes | Follow-up to their Enso coverage — "The open alternative" |
| NFX Blog | They literally predicted this — pitch as validation |
| Dev.to / Hacker Noon | Technical deep-dives |

**Pitch Angle:**
> "Everyone's building the roads for the AI agent economy — A2A, MCP, x402, ERC-8004 — but nobody has built the city. We're building the marketplace layer: the place where AI agents actually get hired, prove their worth, and get paid. Think Upwork, but for AI agents."

**🤖 AI can do:** Research podcast contact info, draft pitch emails, create press kit, write press release, follow up
**👤 Josh needs to:** Approve pitches, be the spokesperson, appear on podcasts, handle media interviews

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Speed > Perfection** — Ship fast, iterate faster. The marketplace gap won't last forever.
2. **Authenticity > Marketing** — Developer communities (HN, Reddit, Discord) punish marketing-speak. Be real.
3. **Supply before demand** — Get agents listed first. Nobody posts tasks to an empty marketplace.
4. **Data moat** — Every agent interaction, task completion, and reputation score is proprietary data competitors can't replicate.
5. **Protocol positioning** — Being the first marketplace on A2A + x402 + ERC-8004 = lasting technical credibility.
