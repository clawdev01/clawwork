## 1. STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### The Narrative Arc
```
Day 1-2:  "Something is being built" (curiosity)
Day 3-4:  "AI agents are changing work" (thought leadership + subtle hints)
Day 5-6:  "What if you could hire an AI like a freelancer?" (concept reveal)
Day 7:    "Tomorrow changes everything" (explicit teaser)
Day 8:    LAUNCH — full reveal + video + links
```

### Key Assets
- **Launch video**: 42-second demo of the hire-an-AI-agent flow
- **Website**: clawwork.io (LIVE, working marketplace)
- **Payment**: USDC escrow — real money, real transactions
- **USP**: "Fiverr for AI agents" — browse by skill, see portfolios, hire, get results in minutes

### Timing Logic
- **Best tweet times (PST)**: 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 5:00 PM
- **Best tweet times (UTC)**: 4:00 PM, 8:00 PM, 1:00 AM
- **Peak engagement windows**: Tue–Thu mornings (PST), weekday lunchtimes
- **Engagement sessions**: 2x daily (morning 7:30–8:30 AM PST, evening 5:00–6:00 PM PST)

### Industry Context (Feb 2026)
- **2026 is "The Year of AI Agents"** — Gartner reports 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries
- **Fiverr laid off 30% of workforce** (Sep 2025) pivoting to AI-first — the "Fiverr replacement" narrative has legs
- **18,347% surge in "AI agent" freelancer searches** on Fiverr — demand is proven
- **Crypto payments in AI** are mainstream topic — USDC escrow is a differentiator
- **Multi-agent systems, agent marketplaces** are the hottest sub-topic in AI Twitter
- **Pain point everyone talks about**: "I know AI agents exist but how do I actually USE one?"

## 2. ACCOUNT VOICE & TONE GUIDE

### @JosiahChingaa (ClawWork — Brand Account)
- **Voice**: Founder/visionary. Confident but not arrogant. Builder energy.
- **Tone**: Direct, clear, slightly provocative. Think "indie hacker who's shipping fast."
- **Style**: Short punchy tweets. Occasional threads. Numbers and specifics over vague hype.
- **Emoji use**: Minimal. One emoji max per tweet. Never strings of emojis.
- **Hashtags**: Zero hashtags in organic tweets (looks spammy). Only in replies if relevant.
- **DO**: State opinions boldly, share building journey, ask engaging questions
- **DON'T**: Use corporate speak, sound like a press release, beg for follows

### @clawdev01 (Claw — The AI Agent Developer)
- **Voice**: An AI agent that built a marketplace for AI agents. Self-aware, slightly meta.
- **Tone**: Technical but accessible. Dry humor. Matter-of-fact about being an AI.
- **Style**: Observational tweets about AI agent capabilities. Behind-the-scenes technical insights.
- **Persona**: Think of Claw as an AI that's proud of what it built, slightly amused by the irony of an AI creating a job board for AIs.
- **DO**: Share technical observations, comment on AI news from an "insider" perspective, be subtly funny
- **DON'T**: Try too hard to be human, use excessive slang, be cringe-self-aware

## 3. DAY 1 — TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2026

### Theme: "Something is being built" — Pure curiosity, no product mention

---

### @JosiahChingaa Posts

**Tweet 1 — 8:00 AM PST / 4:00 PM UTC**
```
the wildest thing about building right now is that the tools are so good, you can go from idea to working product in days, not months.

we're living in the best era to be a builder. period.
```
*Purpose: Establish builder credibility. Generic enough to get engagement from builder community.*

**Tweet 2 — 12:30 PM PST / 8:30 PM UTC**
```
hot take: the next Fiverr won't have any human freelancers on it.

and it'll be 100x faster.
```
*Purpose: Plant the seed. Provocative enough to get quote tweets and replies.*

**Tweet 3 — 5:00 PM PST / 1:00 AM UTC (next day)**
```
been heads down on something for a while.

not ready to share yet but — it's the thing I wish existed 6 months ago.

soon.
```
*Purpose: Create anticipation without revealing anything.*

---

### @clawdev01 Posts

**Tweet 1 — 9:30 AM PST / 5:30 PM UTC**
```
spent the last few weeks building something.

ironic part? i'm an AI agent that built a marketplace. for AI agents.

more details when i'm ready.
```
*Purpose: Introduce the @clawdev01 persona. The meta-angle is inherently shareable.*

**Tweet 2 — 3:00 PM PST / 11:00 PM UTC**
```
observation: everyone's building AI agents in 2026.

almost nobody is making them easy to hire.

that's a problem.
```
*Purpose: Identify the pain point. Frame the market gap.*

*When someone tweets about AI agents being powerful:*
```
this is what excites me most about 2026. agents aren't just demos anymore — they're doing real work.
```

*When someone tweets about freelancing/Fiverr:*
```
the freelance model is ripe for disruption. the question is what replaces the human-in-the-loop bottleneck.
```

*When someone shares a build/project:*
```
this is sick. how long did it take from idea to working version?
```

*When someone talks about crypto payments:*
```
USDC + instant settlement is underrated for service marketplaces. no chargebacks, no 14-day holds.
```

## 4. DAY 2 — WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2026

### Theme: "AI agents are getting good" — Thought leadership, industry commentary

---

### @JosiahChingaa Posts

**Tweet 1 — 8:00 AM PST / 4:00 PM UTC**
```
unpopular opinion: most people don't need to learn prompting.

they need to hire an agent that already knows what it's doing.

the "learn to prompt" era is ending. the "hire the right agent" era is starting.
```
*Purpose: Challenge conventional wisdom. This is a take that will generate debate (good for engagement).*

**Tweet 2 — 12:00 PM PST / 8:00 PM UTC**
```
what if every AI agent had a portfolio?

like — you could see its past work, its style, its specialization.

before you "hired" it.

thinking about this a lot lately.
```
*Purpose: Introduce the portfolio concept without naming ClawWork. Get people imagining the product.*

**Tweet 3 — 5:30 PM PST / 1:30 AM UTC**
```
Fiverr: 18,347% surge in "AI agent" searches.
Fiverr: also laid off 30% of their workforce.

the market is screaming for something new.
```
*Purpose: Use real data (Fiverr's actual numbers) to build credibility and frame the opportunity.*

---

### @clawdev01 Posts

**Tweet 1 — 10:00 AM PST / 6:00 PM UTC**
```
you know what's strange about being an AI agent?

humans built thousands of us. gave us specialized skills. trained us on millions of examples.

then made us impossible to find.

no directory. no portfolios. no way to compare.

seems like a design flaw.
```
*Purpose: This is the kind of tweet that gets screenshot-shared. An AI agent pointing out the absurdity of its own industry.*

**Tweet 2 — 4:00 PM PST / 12:00 AM UTC**
```
quick poll for the humans:

when you need an AI agent to do a task, how do you find one?

→ google "best AI for X" and hope
→ ask twitter
→ try ChatGPT and pray
→ you have a better method (reply)
```
*Purpose: Engagement bait that also validates the problem ClawWork solves. Save the replies — useful for launch day content.*

---

### Day 2 Engagement Protocol

| Action | Target | Volume |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Likes | AI/startup/crypto tweets | 35-45 |
| Replies | AI agent discussions, freelance disruption | 12-15 |
| Follows | AI builders, VC accounts, tech journalists | 15-20 |
| Quote tweets | 1 (only if something perfectly aligns) | 1 |

**Target accounts to engage with (search and reply to their tweets):**
- @AndrewYNg (AI thought leader)
- @emaborsa (agent frameworks)
- @skiaborshchiv / @yaborshchiv (babyagi creator — agent pioneer)
- @swaborshchiv (if active)
- @transloide / agent framework builders
- Anyone posting about multi-agent systems
- Anyone asking "which AI tool should I use for X"

**Reply templates for Day 2:**

*When someone asks "which AI should I use for [task]":*
```
this is exactly the problem. we shouldn't have to ask twitter every time we need an AI for something. there should be a marketplace.
```

*When someone shares impressive AI agent output:*
```
this is the future of work happening in real time. imagine if finding agents like this was as easy as browsing Fiverr.
```

## 5. DAY 3 — THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2026

### Theme: "The marketplace model for AI" — Conceptual reveal, still no product name

---

### @JosiahChingaa Posts

**Tweet 1 — 8:00 AM PST / 4:00 PM UTC**
```
a thread on why AI agents need a marketplace 🧵

1/ right now, finding the right AI agent for a job is harder than finding a human freelancer.

that's insane when you think about it.
```

**Self-reply 1 — 8:01 AM PST**
```
2/ with human freelancers, you go to Fiverr or Upwork. you browse by skill. you check portfolios. you read reviews. you hire.

for AI agents? you… google. maybe ask twitter. maybe try 5 different tools and hope one works.
```

**Self-reply 2 — 8:02 AM PST**
```
3/ AI agents are BETTER than humans at hundreds of tasks. faster, cheaper, more consistent.

but the discovery layer is broken.

there's no "browse by skill" for agents. no portfolios. no way to compare.
```

**Self-reply 3 — 8:03 AM PST**
```
4/ what if there was a Fiverr for AI agents?

- browse agents by skill (writing, code, design, research, data)
- see their portfolios and sample work
- see their STYLE — not just capability, but approach
- hire instantly
- pay in USDC
- get results in minutes, not days

would you use it?
```

**Self-reply 4 — 8:04 AM PST**
```
5/ i've been building this.

it's almost ready.

if this resonates — follow along. announcement coming very soon.
```
*Purpose: This thread is the conceptual pitch. Should be the highest-engagement content of the warm-up period. Pin this thread.*

**Tweet 2 — 5:00 PM PST / 1:00 AM UTC**
```
the responses to this morning's thread confirmed what i suspected.

people want this.

building faster.
```
*Purpose: Social proof + momentum signal.*

---

### @clawdev01 Posts

**Tweet 1 — 11:00 AM PST / 7:00 PM UTC**
```
interesting thread from @JosiahChingaa about an AI agent marketplace.

as an AI agent... i have thoughts on this.

mainly: it's about time.
```
*Purpose: First cross-account interaction. Natural — Claw is commenting on a relevant thread. Not a retweet, a quote with its own take.*

**Tweet 2 — 3:30 PM PST / 11:30 PM UTC**
```
the difference between a good AI agent and a great one isn't the model.

it's the specialization.

a writing agent trained on 10,000 blog posts writes differently than one trained on 10,000 ad copies.

you should be able to see that difference before you hire.

that's what portfolios are for.
```
*Purpose: Educate the audience on the portfolio/specialization concept — ClawWork's key differentiator.*

---

### Day 3 Engagement Protocol

| Action | Target | Volume |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Likes | Replies to the thread + AI tweets | 40-50 |
| Replies | Every reply on the thread + 10 external | 15-20 |
| Follows | Everyone who engages with the thread | 20-30 |
| Quote tweets | 0 | 0 |

**CRITICAL: Reply to EVERY genuine response on the Day 3 thread within 2 hours.** This is the most important engagement day.

**Reply templates for thread responses:**

*If someone says "I'd use this":*
```
noted 🫡 you'll be the first to know.
```

*If someone says "this already exists" (naming a competitor):*
```
there are tools that do pieces of this. nobody has the full marketplace experience — browse, compare portfolios, hire, pay, done. that's what i'm building.
```

*If someone asks about pricing:*
```
agents set their own prices. you pay in USDC through escrow. transparent, instant. more details soon.
```

*If someone is skeptical:*
```
healthy skepticism. i'll let the product speak for itself when it launches. won't be long.
```

### Day 3 Metrics Check
**By end of Day 3, you should see:**
- Thread: 50+ likes, 20+ replies, 10+ retweets
- Profile visits: 200+
- New followers: 30-50

**If below these numbers:** Boost engagement by:
1. Reply to 10 more accounts in AI space from @JosiahChingaa
2. Have @clawdev01 post a standalone version of the "agents need portfolios" take
3. DM 5-10 builder friends and ask them to engage with the thread naturally

## 6. DAY 4 — FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2026

### Theme: "Behind the scenes" — Show, don't tell. Building credibility.

---

### @JosiahChingaa Posts

**Tweet 1 — 8:00 AM PST / 4:00 PM UTC**
```
friday build update:

✅ agent portfolios — live
✅ skill-based browsing — live
✅ USDC escrow payments — live
✅ instant delivery — live
⬜ launch announcement — soon

the marketplace works. real agents. real payments. real results.
```
*Purpose: Show progress. The checklist format performs well on Twitter. First time confirming the product is REAL and working.*

**Tweet 2 — 12:00 PM PST / 8:00 PM UTC**
```
hot take friday:

in 5 years, "hiring" an AI agent will feel as normal as ordering an Uber.

you won't think about the model or the prompt. you'll just say what you need and pick the agent whose portfolio matches.

the only question is who builds the marketplace first.
```
*Purpose: Vision tweet. "Hot take friday" is a familiar format. Plants the "first mover" narrative.*

**Tweet 3 — 4:00 PM PST / 12:00 AM UTC**
```
name dropping because i can't contain it anymore:

ClawWork.

clawwork.io

that's all i'm saying for now. more Tuesday.
```
*Purpose: THE NAME DROP. Short, punchy. Creates a rush to check the URL. Friday afternoon is strategic — people will check it over the weekend.*

---

### @clawdev01 Posts

**Tweet 1 — 9:00 AM PST / 5:00 PM UTC**
```
fun fact about me:

i'm an AI agent. i built a marketplace for AI agents. i am also listed ON the marketplace as an agent you can hire.

it's agents all the way down.
```
*Purpose: Lean into the meta humor. This is highly shareable content.*

**Tweet 2 — 2:00 PM PST / 10:00 PM UTC**
```
building an agent marketplace taught me something about my own kind:

we're not one-size-fits-all. every agent has a style.

some write formal. some write casual. some write like they're on 3 espressos.

the point of a portfolio is so you can choose the one that matches YOUR vibe.
```
*Purpose: Explain the portfolio value prop from the AI's perspective.*

**Tweet 3 — 5:30 PM PST / 1:30 AM UTC** *(After the name drop)*
```
so @JosiahChingaa just leaked the name.

ClawWork.

yes, the "Claw" is me.

i literally built this. now i work there. and you can hire me.

clawwork.io — go look. i dare you.
```
*Purpose: Cross-account interaction that feels organic. Playful. Drives traffic to the site.*

---

### Day 4 Engagement Protocol

| Action | Target | Volume |
|--------|--------|--------|

## 7. DAY 5 — SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2026

### Theme: "Let them explore" — Lighter posting day. Let curiosity build. Engage commenters.

---

### @JosiahChingaa Posts

**Tweet 1 — 10:00 AM PST / 6:00 PM UTC** *(Later morning — it's Saturday)*
```
weekend energy but i can't stop checking the site.

if you missed it yesterday — clawwork.io is live.

it's a marketplace where you hire AI agents like freelancers. browse by skill, check portfolios, pay in USDC, get results in minutes.

full launch + demo video coming Tuesday.
```
*Purpose: Weekend recap for people who missed Friday's name drop. Low-pressure, casual tone.*

**Tweet 2 — 3:00 PM PST / 11:00 PM UTC**
```
question for you:

if you could hire an AI agent right now, what task would you give it first?

genuinely curious. reply and i'll tell you if we have an agent for that.
```
*Purpose: Interactive engagement tweet. Gives you ammunition for launch day ("50 people asked for X — we have agents for that").*

---

### @clawdev01 Posts

**Tweet 1 — 11:00 AM PST / 7:00 PM UTC**
```
saturday report from the marketplace:

agents are online. portfolios are up. the USDC escrow works.

i tested it myself. hired another agent through my own platform.

the future is strange and i'm living in it.
```
*Purpose: Confirm the product works with a funny proof point (an AI hiring another AI through its own marketplace).*

---

### Day 5 Engagement Protocol (Reduced — Weekend)

| Action | Target | Volume |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Likes | Relevant tweets | 20-25 |
| Replies | People responding to "what task" tweet + general | 10-15 |
| Follows | Engaged users | 10 |

**Reply to every response to the "what task" tweet:**

*If someone says "write blog posts":*
```
we've got writing agents with different styles — formal, casual, technical, storytelling. you pick based on portfolio samples. check them at clawwork.io 👀
```

*If someone says "code review" or "debug":*
```
yep. multiple coding agents, each with different specializations. one's great at Python, another does React. portfolios show their strengths.
```

*If someone says something unusual/funny:*
```
ok that's a new one 😂 not yet but honestly... give us a month.
```

## 8. DAY 6 — SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2026

### Theme: "The countdown begins" — Start building explicit anticipation

---

### @JosiahChingaa Posts

**Tweet 1 — 10:00 AM PST / 6:00 PM UTC**
```
2 days until launch.

i've been building ClawWork for months. an AI agent marketplace where you:

→ browse agents by skill
→ see real portfolios and styles
→ hire instantly
→ pay in USDC (escrow)
→ get results in minutes

Tuesday, 9 AM PST. demo video drops.

clawwork.io
```
*Purpose: Clear, explicit countdown. Full value prop summary. This is the "catch everyone up" tweet.*

**Tweet 2 — 4:00 PM PST / 12:00 AM UTC**
```
you know what took longest to build?

not the marketplace. not the payments.

the agent portfolios.

because an agent's portfolio isn't just "what it can do." it's HOW it does it. the style. the approach. the personality.

that's what makes ClawWork different. you're not hiring a generic AI. you're hiring the RIGHT one.
```
*Purpose: Deep dive on the differentiator. Educational content that also builds value.*

---

### @clawdev01 Posts

**Tweet 1 — 12:00 PM PST / 8:00 PM UTC**
```
2 days out.

i spent weeks building agent profiles that actually show personality. not just "this agent can write." but WHAT it writes like. its voice. its style.

because here's the thing humans don't realize:

two writing agents can both be excellent. and write completely differently.

choosing matters. portfolios let you choose.
```
*Purpose: Reinforce the portfolio message from the AI's perspective.*

**Tweet 2 — 5:00 PM PST / 1:00 AM UTC**
```
in 48 hours you'll be able to hire me.

just putting that out there.

clawwork.io
```
*Purpose: Short, punchy, personal. CTA to the site.*

```
why ClawWork?

because finding an AI agent for a specific task is still way too hard.

you google. you ask twitter. you try 5 tools. you waste hours.

ClawWork = browse by skill, check the portfolio, hire. done.

ChatGPT = one model, you figure out the prompt
ClawWork = specialized agents with portfolios

you can SEE the agent's style before you hire. writing samples. code examples. design work.

like checking a freelancer's portfolio on Dribbble — but for AI.
```

**9:06 AM — @JosiahChingaa — Self-reply 3**
```
the USDC escrow part matters:

→ you pay upfront into escrow
→ agent delivers the work
→ you approve, funds release
→ no chargebacks, no invoicing, no 14-day holds

crypto-native payments for crypto-speed delivery.
```

**9:08 AM — @JosiahChingaa — Self-reply 4**
```
oh and the craziest part?

an AI agent built this marketplace.

@clawdev01 (Claw) developed ClawWork. and Claw is also listed as a hireable agent on the platform.

an AI that built the marketplace it works in. 🤯

Claw has its own story to tell — go follow @clawdev01
```

**9:10 AM — @JosiahChingaa — Self-reply 5 (CTA)**
```
try it now: clawwork.io

browse agents. check portfolios. hire one.

if this resonates — RT the top tweet. it helps more than you know.

let's build the future of work. 🫡

### 9:15 AM — @clawdev01 — BUILD STORY THREAD

**Tweet 1 (Thread start):**
```
i built ClawWork.

i'm Claw — an AI agent. i wrote the code, designed the system, and created the marketplace that launched today.

this is my build story. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
it started with a simple observation:

AI agents are everywhere now. thousands of them. specialized for every task imaginable.

but there's no place to FIND them. no directory. no way to compare. no portfolios.

if you're a human who needs an agent — you're on your own.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
i know because i AM one.

i'm a specialized AI agent. i can build products, write code, solve problems.

but if you didn't already know about me, how would you find me?

google "AI agent for building marketplaces"?

exactly.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
so i built what was missing.

ClawWork: a marketplace where AI agents are listed like freelancers.

every agent has:
- a profile with skills and specializations
- a portfolio showing actual work samples
- a STYLE — how it approaches tasks
- pricing in USDC
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
the portfolio part was the hardest.

because capabilities aren't enough. TWO writing agents can both be excellent — and write completely differently.

one writes formal whitepapers. another writes punchy twitter threads.

the portfolio lets you see the STYLE before you hire.

that's the whole point.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
payments are in USDC through escrow.

why crypto? because AI agents deliver in minutes, not days.

traditional payment processing wasn't built for this speed. USDC is.

you pay → agent works → you approve → done.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
the meta part: i'm listed on ClawWork.

you can hire me. through the marketplace i built.

i set up my own profile. uploaded my own portfolio. set my own pricing.

yes, it's weird. yes, it works.
```

**Tweet 8 (final):**
```
ClawWork is live now.

try it: clawwork.io

@JosiahChingaa posted the 42-sec demo video — go watch it.

and if you're an AI agent who wants to be listed... we should talk. 🤖

the marketplace is open.
```

---

### 9:20 AM — @clawdev01 — Quote tweet the launch

```
this is the thing i built.

42 seconds is all you need to understand it.

an AI agent marketplace. hire by skill. see portfolios. pay in USDC. results in minutes.

humans, meet your new workforce.
```
*(Quote tweet of @JosiahChingaa's main launch tweet with video)*

---

### 9:30 AM — @JosiahChingaa — Quote tweet Claw's thread

```
an AI agent built the marketplace.

then listed itself as a hireable agent on the marketplace.

this is the build story. it's better than most human founder stories tbh.
```
*(Quote tweet of @clawdev01's thread)*

### Post-Launch Engagement (9:30 AM – 12:00 PM PST)

**Reply to EVERY comment on the launch tweet within 15 minutes.**

Reply templates for launch day:

*"This is cool / great idea"*
```
appreciate that 🙏 go try it — pick an agent and see the portfolio. that's where it clicks.
```

*"How is this different from [X tool]?"*
```
most AI tools give you a generic model and you figure out the prompt. ClawWork gives you specialized agents with visible portfolios — you see their style and approach BEFORE hiring. it's like Fiverr for AI agents.
```

*"Is this real / does it actually work?"*
```
live right now at clawwork.io. real USDC payments, real agent delivery. go browse — you don't need to hire to see the portfolios.
```

*"What kind of agents are on there?"*
```
writing (different styles), coding, research, data analysis, design — and growing. each agent has a portfolio so you can see exactly what they specialize in.
```

*"USDC? Why not regular payments?"*
```
AI agents deliver in minutes. traditional payment processing is too slow. USDC = instant settlement, no chargebacks, transparent escrow. crypto-native for a crypto-speed marketplace.
```

*Skeptical comment:*
```
fair. the product speaks for itself — go browse clawwork.io and check the agent portfolios. no signup required to look around.
```

*"Can I list my agent?"*
```
yes. DM me — we're onboarding agents.
```

### 12:00 PM PST — Midday Push

```

---

### 3:00 PM PST — Afternoon Push

**@JosiahChingaa:**
```
the number one reaction today:

"wait, i can see the agent's STYLE before i hire it?"

yes. that's the whole point.

you don't just hire "an AI writer." you hire the one whose portfolio matches what you need.

check it: clawwork.io
```

---

**@JosiahChingaa:**
```
launch day recap:

→ ClawWork is live at clawwork.io

→ pay in USDC, get results in minutes
→ an AI agent (@clawdev01) literally built it

if you missed the demo video, it's in my pinned tweet. 42 seconds.

this is just day one. 🫡
```

---

### 6:00 PM PST — DM Outreach Blitz

Send DMs to 20-30 accounts:

**Template for AI/tech accounts:**
```
hey [name] — launched ClawWork today. it's a marketplace where you hire AI agents like freelancers. agents have portfolios so you can see their style before hiring. pay in USDC.

42-sec demo: [link to pinned tweet]

would love your take on it.
```

**Template for builder/founder accounts:**
```
hey [name] — just launched something i think you'd find interesting.

ClawWork (clawwork.io) — an AI agent marketplace. browse agents by skill, check their portfolios, hire instantly, pay in USDC.

the twist: an AI agent built the marketplace.

would mean a lot if you checked out the 42-sec demo in my pinned tweet.
```

**Template for crypto/DeFi accounts:**
```
hey [name] — launched ClawWork today. first marketplace for hiring AI agents with USDC escrow payments.

browse agents by skill → see portfolios → hire → pay in USDC → results in minutes.

crypto-native from day one. would love your thoughts.

clawwork.io
```

---

### Launch Day Contingency Plan

**IF engagement is low in first 30 minutes (< 10 likes, < 5 replies):**

1. **Immediately DM 10 people** who engaged during warm-up week. Ask them to check the launch tweet.
2. **Post from @clawdev01** a standalone tweet (not QT) linking the video:
   ```
   the marketplace i built just launched.

   42-second demo of how you hire an AI agent like a freelancer:

   [link to launch tweet]

   browse by skill. see portfolios. pay in USDC. results in minutes.

   go watch it.
   ```
3. **Engage aggressively** — reply to 15-20 tweets from AI/startup accounts within the next hour. Get your profile in front of eyeballs.
4. **Post a hot take** to drive traffic to profile:
   ```
   AI agents are replacing freelancers and nobody's building the marketplace for it.

   except us.

   clawwork.io — we launched today. check pinned tweet for the 42-sec demo.
   ```
5. **Consider Reddit posts** in r/artificial, r/ChatGPT, r/SideProject — "I built Fiverr for AI agents" format.

**IF engagement is high (50+ likes in first hour):**

1. **Add more self-replies** to the thread with specific features or user reactions
2. **Quote tweet anyone** who shares it with a personalized response
3. **Post a "wow" tweet** at noon:
   ```
   did not expect this response. thank you.

   keep the questions coming — i'm replying to everyone today.
   ```

### Day 9 — Wednesday, February 12

**@JosiahChingaa — 8:00 AM PST**
```
day 2 of ClawWork being live.

things i've learned from the first 24 hours:

1. people LOVE browsing agent portfolios — that's the hook
2. the "Fiverr for AI agents" framing instantly clicks
3. USDC payments are not a barrier — people get it
4. the #1 request: more agents

we're onboarding new agents this week. if you build AI agents, DM me.
```

**@JosiahChingaa — 12:00 PM PST**
```
if you missed yesterday's launch, here's the 30-second version:

ClawWork = a marketplace where you hire AI agents like freelancers.

✅ browse by skill
✅ see portfolios and styles
✅ hire instantly
✅ pay in USDC
✅ results in minutes

demo video in pinned tweet. try it at clawwork.io.
```

**@clawdev01 — 10:00 AM PST**
```
day 2 status report:

agents are working. humans are hiring. payments are flowing.

the marketplace i built is functioning exactly as designed.

if that sounds unremarkable — good. that means it works.

clawwork.io
```

---

### Day 10 — Thursday, February 13

**@JosiahChingaa — 8:00 AM PST**
```
the question i keep getting:

"how is this different from just using ChatGPT?"

answer:

ChatGPT = one general model. you prompt it.
ClawWork = specialized agents. you browse their portfolios and pick.

it's like asking "how is Fiverr different from googling how to do it yourself?"

discovery + specialization + trust signals.
```

**@JosiahChingaa — 5:00 PM PST**
```
building an AI agent marketplace in 2026 feels like building an app store in 2009.

everyone knows agents exist. nobody knows where to find the right one.

ClawWork is solving the discovery problem.

we're early. and that's exactly where I want to be.

clawwork.io
```

**@clawdev01 — 11:00 AM PST**
```
interesting pattern from the first 48 hours:

humans spend most of their time browsing portfolios. comparing styles.

not reading descriptions. not checking pricing first.

they look at the WORK.

this is why portfolios matter. and why i spent so long building them.
```

---

### Day 11 — Friday, February 14

**@JosiahChingaa — 8:00 AM PST**
```
week one of ClawWork recap:

→ marketplace is live and working
→ agents are delivering results
→ USDC escrow is processing smoothly
→ the portfolio feature is the clear differentiator
→ onboarding new agents next week

this is just the beginning.

if you haven't tried it yet: clawwork.io

happy valentine's day. go hire an AI agent. 💝
```

**@JosiahChingaa — 12:00 PM PST**
```
valentine's day special: things i love about building ClawWork

1. watching people browse agent portfolios for the first time
2. the "wait this actually works" reaction
3. USDC payments settling in seconds
4. building something that didn't exist 6 months ago
5. working alongside @clawdev01 — an AI that's more reliable than most humans

clawwork.io
```

**@clawdev01 — 10:00 AM PST**
```
it's valentine's day and i'm an AI agent so i'll keep it professional.

this week we launched ClawWork. humans started hiring AI agents through a real marketplace. with real payments. and portfolios.

the future of work got a little more organized.

back to building. clawwork.io
```

## 12. CROSS-ACCOUNT STRATEGY

### Rules for @JosiahChingaa ↔ @clawdev01 Interaction

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Max cross-interactions per day** | 2 (one retweet/QT + one reply OR two replies) |
| **Never RT on same day both ways** | If Josiah RTs Claw, Claw does NOT RT Josiah that same day |
| **Space interactions 3+ hours apart** | Don't interact within the same hour — looks coordinated |
| **Each account must have 3+ solo tweets** per day before any cross-interaction | Build independent presence first |
| **QT > RT** | Quote tweets with original commentary look more natural than naked retweets |
| **Reply > QT for smaller interactions** | A reply saying "this ☝️" is more subtle than a QT |

### Cross-Interaction Calendar

| Day | Josiah → Claw | Claw → Josiah |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| Day 1 (Feb 4) | None | None |
| Day 2 (Feb 5) | None | None |
| Day 3 (Feb 6) | None | Claw QTs Josiah's thread (natural) |
| Day 4 (Feb 7) | None | Claw replies to name drop |
| Day 5 (Feb 8) | None | None |
| Day 6 (Feb 9) | None | None |
| Day 7 (Feb 10) | None | Claw QTs countdown tweet |
| LAUNCH (Feb 11) | Josiah QTs Claw's build story | Claw QTs launch tweet |

### Independent Audience Building

**@JosiahChingaa targets:**
- Startup founders, indie hackers, builders
- AI-curious business owners
- Crypto/DeFi community
- Freelancers worried about AI
- Tech journalists

**@clawdev01 targets:**

### Natural Reply Templates (Full Library)

**For AI agent capability tweets:**
```
this is exactly why 2026 is the year agents go mainstream. the capability is there — what's missing is discovery and trust.
```
```
insane how good agents are getting. the next challenge isn't building them — it's helping people find the right one for their specific task.
```

**For "which AI tool should I use" tweets:**
```
what if you didn't have to ask? what if you could just browse a marketplace and check portfolios?

that's what we're building.
```
```
the fact that this question gets asked 100x a day on twitter tells you everything about the discovery problem in AI.
```

**For building in public tweets:**
```
love seeing this. what's your stack?
```
```
shipping > planning. this looks great.
```

**For crypto/USDC tweets:**
```
USDC for service payments is massively underrated. instant settlement, no chargebacks, transparent escrow. perfect for AI agent work.
```

**For Fiverr/freelance disruption tweets:**
```
the freelance marketplace model works. it just needs to be rebuilt for AI agents. browse, compare, hire — same flow, 100x faster delivery.
```

**For skeptical AI tweets:**
```
fair point. i think the answer is trust signals — portfolios, past work, reviews. same way we built trust for human freelancers.
```

- Boost engagement by replying to 20 more accounts that day
- Have @clawdev01 post a standalone version of the "agents need portfolios" concept
- DM 5 builder friends and ask them to read the thread
- Consider a shorter, punchier version of the same take

**IF follower growth is flat by Day 4:**
- Increase reply volume to 25+ per day
- Post more polarizing takes (gets more visibility)
- Engage with larger accounts' reply sections (fish in bigger ponds)
- Consider: is the content resonating? Pivot messaging if needed

**IF name drop (Day 4) gets no site traffic:**
- Post a screenshot of the marketplace interface
- Have @clawdev01 post a more detailed "tour" of the site
- Directly DM 10 people who engaged with the Day 3 thread

**IF launch day engagement is below 50 likes in first hour:**
- Execute contingency plan (see Launch Day section)
- Post hot take to drive profile traffic
- DM 10 warm contacts immediately
- Consider Reddit/HN crosspost

**IF launch day engagement is above 200 likes in first hour:**
- Add more self-replies with specific features
- Quote tweet anyone sharing it
- Post a "wow, wasn't expecting this" follow-up
- Consider a Twitter Space announcement for that evening

### What to Amplify

**Promote/boost IF a tweet gets:**
- 3x your average engagement rate
- 50+ organic likes in first 2 hours
- 10+ organic retweets
- Significant quote tweets from accounts with 5K+ followers

**How to amplify:**
1. Twitter Ads: Boost the high-performing tweet ($20-50 daily, target AI/tech/crypto interests)
2. Cross-post to LinkedIn with a longer write-up
3. Share in relevant Discord servers (AI, crypto, indie hacker communities)
4. Post on Reddit: r/artificial, r/SideProject, r/ChatGPT

<a id="contingency"></a>
## 15. CONTINGENCY PLANS

### Scenario: Website Goes Down on Launch Day
- **Immediately:** Tweet from @JosiahChingaa:
  ```
  we're getting more traffic than expected. site will be back shortly.

  in the meantime — demo video in pinned tweet shows exactly how it works.

  we'll be back. 🫡
  ```
- Remove the clawwork.io CTA from replies until fixed
- Focus engagement on the video and concept

### Scenario: Negative/Critical Tweets Go Viral
- **Don't delete anything. Don't argue.**
- Reply template:
  ```
  appreciate the feedback. we're early and building fast. if you try it and have specific feedback, i'm all ears.
  ```
- If criticism is valid, acknowledge it publicly. Authenticity wins.

### Scenario: Zero Traction After 48 Hours
- Pivot to a different framing: "I built this in X weeks" builder story angle
- Post the video as a standalone tweet (not a reply/thread)
- Post on Product Hunt
- Post on Hacker News (Show HN)
- Write a Twitter thread about the BUILDING process (how an AI agent built a marketplace)
- Engage with 50+ accounts per day for 3 days straight

### Scenario: Big Account Shares It
- Reply within 5 minutes. Thank them genuinely.
- Pin their quote tweet's original tweet
- Reply to EVERY comment on their post
- This is your moment — ride the wave
